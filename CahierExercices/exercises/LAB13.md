# LAB 13 : Match 

We follow DDD concept to create function related to Match in the class.

## Display first round matches like this : 
*- Player1 0 - 0 Player2*

- Add test `should display match` in MatchTest class
- Add score property as Pair object
- Override the toString() method in the Match class

## Update match score
- Add test `should update score to match` in MatchTest class
- Create function to update match score with a Pair object as argument. The match is still immutable.

# And the winner is
- Create a function that return the winner of the match. Even score should throw an IllegalStateException
