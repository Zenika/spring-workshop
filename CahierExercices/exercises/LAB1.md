## Code cleanup

This code is horrible ! Time for a good refactoring

- Refactor code in accordance to SOLID principles
  - Separate layers : introduce model, data access, business logic
  - Emilimate code redundency
  - Be mindful of the packaging : different layers shouldn't reside in the same java package
