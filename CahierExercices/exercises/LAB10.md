# LAB 10 : Enum

To define the round name, we are going to implement an enum based on the following link

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament

We limit the number of players to 32.

## Create the **RoundName** enum
- Define the **RoundName** enum in the same Kotlin file used to define the **Round** data class.

We'll use this enumeration later
