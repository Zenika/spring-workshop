Duration: 2d

Price: ?â‚¬

## Description

Kotlin is the programming language created by JetBrains in 2011. It can be compiled to Java bytecode for the JVM, transpiled to JavaScript and more with the LLVM Compiler. The language goals are to be compatible with existing codebases, to leverage functional programming easily, to simplify code writing and to free developers from the burden of common mistakes.

Kotlin popularity is growing since the official release of version 1.0. It's becoming a reference for more and more use cases: mobile (Android), backend (Spring) and tooling (Gradle).

During this training we will introduce the key concepts of the language, giving you the hability to develop your next frontend, backend, tooling or native project with Kotlin.
