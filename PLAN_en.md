# Spring Workshop - Java backends without worry

## Learning how to develop a Java backend

Duration: 3j

Price: ?€

## Presentation

For the development of modern REST backends, the Java ecosystem remains a must.

In particular, the Spring framework provides a library of functionalities covering all the technical needs typically needed for the implementation of robust backends, and offers substantial assistance to developers in terms of productivity and production of state-of-the-art code.

In this training session we will introduce best practises to the development of a robust backends as well as an overview of the Spring framework.

The intern will discover Spring during the workshop through the transforming of a single rudimentary class into a complete REST backend.

## Objectifs
